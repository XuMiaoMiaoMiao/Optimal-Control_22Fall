Below is a simple table of contents for the Practice : 

- Practice 1 ： 
  - Finding the minima using static optimization.
  - Finding the global minimum $J(x, u)$ based on necessary and sufficient conditions.
  - Gradient descent methods.
- Practice 2 ： 
  - Optimal control design for LTI plant (LQR)
- Practice 3 ： 
  - Optimal observer (Kalman filter)
- Practice 4 ： 
  - Optimal control design with free and fixed initial state point
- Practice 5 ：
